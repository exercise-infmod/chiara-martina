        <p><b>Willie Nelson and Trigger in November 2011</b></p>
        <p>The guitar—a Martin N-20 classical, serial number 242830—was a gorgeous instrument, with a warm, sweet tone and a pretty “mellow yellow” coloring. The top was made of Sitka spruce, which came from the Pacific Northwest; the back and sides were Brazilian rosewood. The fretboard and bridge were ebony from Africa, and the neck was mahogany from the Amazon basin. The brass tuning pegs came from Germany. All of these components had been gathered in the Martin guitar factory in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, and cut, bent, and glued together, then lacquered, buffed, and polished. If the guitar had been shipped to New York or Chicago, it might have been purchased by a budding flamenco guitarist or a Segovia wannabe. Instead it was sent to a guitarist in Nashville named Shot Jackson, who repaired and sold guitars out of a shop near the Grand Ole Opry. In 1969 it was bought by a struggling country singer, a guy who had a pig farm, a failing marriage, and a crappy record deal.</p>
        <p>Willie Nelson had a new guitar.</p>
        <p>Forty-three years later—after some 10,000 shows, recording sessions, jam sessions, songwriting sessions, and guitar pulls, most taking place amid a haze of tobacco and reefer smoke and carried out with a particular brand of string-pounding, neck-throttling violence—the guitar looks like hell. The frets are so worn it’s a wonder any tone emerges at all. The face is covered in scars, cuts, and autographs scraped into the wood. Next to the bridge is a giant maw, a gaping hole that looks like it was created by someone swinging a hammer.</p>
        <p>Most guitars don’t have names. This one, of course, does. Trigger has a voice and a personality, and he bears a striking resemblance to his owner. Willie’s face is lined with age and his body is bent with experience. He’s been battered by divorce, the IRS, his son Billy’s suicide, and the loss of close friends like Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and his longtime bass player Bee Spears. In the past decade, Willie has had carpal tunnel surgery on his left hand, torn a rotator cuff, and ruptured a bicep. The man of flesh and bone has a lot in common with the guitar of wire and wood.</p>
        <p>“Trigger’s like me,” Willie said with a laugh on a cool morning last April at his ranch by the Pedernales River. “Old and beat-up.”</p>
        <p>He cradled the guitar in his lap, pulled out a pick, and began to play. The song was one of his favorites, Django Reinhardt’s “Nuages,” a melancholy instrumental that was popular in France during the Nazi occupation. Willie knows every square centimeter of Trigger, and the fingers on his left hand ascended the rough fretboard and played the high yearning riff that begins each verse, then descended, gently following the melody as the fingers on his right hand picked single notes and plucked chords. He played the riff again, this time descending quickly, bending a string and shaking the guitar’s battered neck. He started to play the melody again, then bounced a chord off it—<i>da da!</i>—and started to play some other notes, but they slammed into each other—<i>blonk!</i>—and he went back to the main theme. He played the verse again, rushing it slightly and throwing in a succession of loud, falling notes that changed the tune. At the end he paused and finished with a cascade of sounds, like a leaf falling from a tree.</p>
        <p>After a sip of coffee, Willie bent his head and played another Django song, fingering a melody at the top of Trigger’s fretboard and playing a descending riff based around a jazz chord. Willie’s hands are large and veined, and his fingers moved quickly over the strings. They sped to the top again for the second verse, and this time the middle finger on his right hand strummed the strings Spanish-style so quickly it looked like a hummingbird. The song came to the bridge, and Willie played loud, clashing chords, then went back to the verse. He ended with a final clanging descent and a soft chord.</p>
        <p>Willie Nelson, the country songwriter, pop crooner, outlaw hero, marijuana scofflaw, and farmer’s friend, is also a jazz musician. A really good jazz musician. He improvises, plays what he feels, makes mistakes, and plays some more, always coming back to the melody, buzzing around it like a bee. Some guitarists are careful about every note; they handle their instruments as carefully as a landscape artist handles a brush. Willie treats Trigger like a horse, and he rides him hard.</p>
        <p>Willie became the guitarist he is by playing this instrument, which he has worn and shaped with his own hands, working his very personality into the wood until it sounds like no other guitar on earth. Most nylon-stringed guitars have a rich, round tone, and they are difficult to tell apart. Trigger is so distinctive—low tones that thump like they have mud on them, high ones that chime like glass—that you can hear one or two notes on the radio and know immediately whom you’re listening to.</p>
        <p>No guitar is as beloved—or as famed. On Trigger’s face you can see the topography of modern music, the countless hours Willie has spent playing country, blues, jazz, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, swing, folk, reggae, thirties pop, forties pop, and eighties pop. Trigger was there at the very beginning of outlaw country. He was there at the first Farm Aid. And he was there when Willie serenaded President Jimmy Carter. He has shared stage and studio with Ray Charles and Bob Dylan. He has hung from Willie’s neck as tens of thousands of fans sang along to “Whiskey River.” And he has sat in Willie’s lap as Willie comforted friends, such as the time the two of them played “Healing Hands of Time” to Darrell and Edith Royal in their home after their daughter’s death, and then again nine years later after their son’s death.</p>
        <p>Without Willie, there would be no Trigger. And it’s only a slight exaggeration to say that without Trigger, there would be no Willie. Willie likes to say that his guitar will probably wear out just about the same time he does. But instead of slowing down, as most people do when they approach their ninth decade, Willie keeps doing the things he’s been doing for years, and so does Trigger. The pair did more than 150 shows this year, and they’ll likely do about that many in 2013. They’ll make some more albums and write some more songs. They’ll play as if they’re going to play forever.</p>
        <br>
		<h2>It All Began With a Drunk</h2>
        <p>According to legend, Roy Rogers stumbled across his famous horse back in 1938 when he was preparing to shoot a movie. The horse was a palomino named Golden Cloud. Rogers rode him, fell in love with how he handled, bought him, and then changed his name. A singing cowboy with a guitar and a gun needed a horse with a name like Trigger.</p>
        <p>According to legend, Willie stumbled across his famous Martin guitar back in 1969, after his previous guitar had been knocked out of commission. He and his band were playing at the John T. Floore Country Store, in Helotes, Willie remembers, and at some point he laid down his Baldwin acoustic guitar in its case on the stage. “A drunk stepped on it,” Willie says. He had a couple of his guys take the guitar back to Nashville, to Shot Jackson, whom Willie had known since the early sixties.</p>
        <p>The thing is, Willie didn’t much care about the guitar, an 800C Electric Classical, which had a thick, beefy neck. The guitar had been a promotional gift from Baldwin—a piano company—in 1968, along with a C1 amp. What Willie really liked was the sound he could get from the guitar’s pickup, a revolutionary Prismatone piezoelectronic model, made with six tiny ceramic sensors. Before the Prismatone, acoustic players like Willie had to play into a microphone, which meant they were usually drowned out by the band. The new pickup allowed him to play an acoustic guitar onstage with a band and actually be heard, especially with the C1 amp, a solid-state piece of machinery that was designed by Baldwin’s organ engineers to work with the Prismatone via a special stereo wiring system. The amp had a brushed aluminum top and five colorful “Supersound” tone buttons—red, lime green, yellow, blue, and purple—that evoked the groovy sixties. “Hear it,” promised the Baldwin catalog, “and you might think it’s a happening!”</p>
        <p>Jackson couldn’t salvage the guitar, he told Willie over the phone. It was too busted up. Jackson did mention, though, that he had a Martin N-20 on hand and could transfer the pickup into it. Martin was the premier maker of steel-stringed guitars; the N-20, which had been introduced the year before, was a nylon-stringed, or gut-string, guitar, an attempt by Martin to make inroads in the Spanish-style market. Willie liked gut-string guitars well enough, but he was a little uncomfortable buying one over the phone. “Is it any good?” he asked. “Well, Martins are known for good guitars,” Jackson responded. Willie asked the price. Seven hundred and fifty dollars, Jackson told him. “I had just bought a roping horse for seven hundred and fifty dollars,” Willie recalls. “So I said, ‘That’s pretty cool.’ ” He bought it, sight unseen.</p>
        <br>
		<h2>Desperately Seeking Django</h2>
        <p>Willie had played a lot of guitars in his life, starting with the Stella his grandparents got him from Sears when he was six and in love with singing cowboys like Roy Rogers. “Strings way up high off the neck and your fingers bleed when you learn to play,” he remembers. He graduated to Gibsons when he was the teenage lead guitarist for Bud Fletcher and the Texans. He practiced by playing along with the Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams songs he heard on the radio. “I’d try to steal every riff I heard,” he says. He loved western swing and the Tin Pan Alley pop music of the early twentieth century, and he sang along with Frank Sinatra. In his twenties he played electric lead guitar with Dave Isbell and the Mission City Playboys, from San Antonio. By then somebody—either Johnny Gimble, a fiddler for Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, or Fort Worth guitarist Oliver English, Willie’s not sure which—had introduced him to the music of Django Reinhardt, the Belgian Gypsy who pioneered jazz guitar in Paris during the thirties.</p>
        <p>“When I first heard Django, I realized he was where a lot of things I had learned up to that point had come from, like western swing,” Willie says. “Johnny Gimble and all the other great fiddle players were jazz players and knew who Django was. All the guitar players knew who Django was. I liked the sound of his guitar but couldn’t get it on whatever I was playing.”</p>
        <p>He searched everywhere for the right guitar. When Willie lived in Houston, in the late fifties, he played an Epiphone steel-stringed acoustic during the day when he taught guitar lessons and a Fender Stratocaster or Telecaster at night in the honky-tonks. But these guitars were just guitars, something to play the songs with, and when he got to Nashville, in 1960, he played whatever came his way—nylon-stringed guitars, steel-stringed Gibsons or Martins, and electrics, such as a Fender Jaguar and the green Epiphone his wife Shirley bought him. He played a Fender Jazzmaster at a show recorded in 1966 for the album <i>Live Country Music Concert</i>, with Johnny Bush on drums and Wade Ray on bass. Willie mostly played rhythm, but he hammered out a solo on “I Never Cared for You” that sounded a lot like the Spanish-style solo that was played on the album version he had released two years earlier. But he hadn’t played it on the record—a guy named Dave Parker had.</p>
        <p>The truth is, Willie rarely played on his Nashville records. After his initial success as a songwriter and recording artist, he had signed in 1964 with RCA, which was intent on turning him into a country crooner. Nashville artists generally weren’t allowed to play on their own albums, nor were their road bands. So Willie made album after album that was heavy on strings and breathy choruses. By 1970 he was miserable. He hated the country music industry. He was going through all kinds of personal changes—reading the poems of Kahlil Gibran and the prophecies of Edgar Cayce, smoking marijuana, and growing his hair long. He was getting big ideas about what he could do with music, ideas that would never fly in Nashville: concept albums, songs about a perfect God, and monologues about an imperfect man. Willie didn’t know it yet, but he was becoming an artist. All he needed was a spark.</p>
        <br>
		<h2>Going Home</h2>
        <p>What he got was an inferno. In late 1970, Willie’s house outside Nashville burned to the ground, cause unknown. He and his family lost just about everything: clothes, furniture, master tapes. The tragedy had a purifying effect, though, wiping out Willie’s unhappy past in Music City and opening up the future. And it gave him a good excuse to get out of Nashville for a while. He jumped at the chance, decamping for Texas. When he left, he took one of the few valuables that had been spared by the flames: his new Martin guitar.</p>
        <p>For the next few months, Willie settled into a house near Bandera while his Nashville home was rebuilt. He sat around contemplating his future and playing his guitar. He hadn’t named the instrument yet—that came much later—but for the first time, Willie had fallen in love with the sound of one of his instruments. “When I found that guitar and amp, I knew that was the sound I was trying to get, that Django sound,” he says. Django had actually played a steel-stringed Selmer guitar, but to Willie, its mellow, plucky tone (a product of the tortoiseshell button Django used as a pick) sounded like a gut-string. Like his Martin.</p>
        <p>Willie returned to Nashville and played the guitar on a few recordings. He used it on a solo on “I’m a Memory,” from 1971’s <i>Willie Nelson and Family</i>, that is simple and lyrical, with a show of force at the end that hints at something he wasn’t quite ready to deliver.</p>
        <p>Later that year Willie found himself at a music-industry guitar pull at the home of songwriter Harlan Howard. Willie didn’t get his turn until two in the morning, and he sat on a stool, held his Martin in his lap, and played songs from <i>Phases and Stages</i>, a concept album he’d been working on that told both sides of a divorce. The party was almost over—half the crowd had gone—but Willie and his guitar turned the quiet to their advantage, making the spare songs of longing and regret sound like the desolate poetry of love. When he finished, a bearded man walked up to Willie and introduced himself—it was Jerry Wexler, who had discovered and produced some of the greatest soul and R&B artists of the sixties. He was starting a country division at Atlantic Records, he said, and he wanted to release those songs.</p>
        <p>Willie signed with Atlantic, which offered him the creative freedom he had longed for. Then he made an even bigger change: he abandoned Nashville and moved back to Texas, to a ranch west of Austin. He came home. His first album for Atlantic was <i>Shotgun Willie</i>, and the new Willie and his guitar introduced themselves at the start of the first song, the lazy, bluesy title track. Willie riffed on his Martin throughout “Shotgun Willie,” then soloed for the last 30 seconds of a 2:43 song. The next song was “Whiskey River,” and again he played a bluesy solo, this time in the middle. “Those two songs are the ones where I really started changing,” Willie says, “where I switched into blues more, rock ’n’ roll blues stuff.” The guitar led the way, guiding songs, lurching and pulling them along.</p>
        <p>The Martin was already beginning to show signs of early wear. In 1974 Willie was the debut act on <i>Austin City Limits</i>. When you watch the episode now, he and his guitar look impossibly young. His beard is red, his guitar’s face is shiny and yellow, but it’s already got a small hole near the bridge, the result of his pinkie and ring finger digging into the wood as he played. “When I saw the hole coming in there, I didn’t panic or anything,” he says. “Growing up, I played a guitar that had a big, round hole.” On “Whiskey River,” you can see Willie’s two lower fingers curling above the hole while he picks. The guitar, plugged into the Baldwin amp, sounds clear and earthy, and Willie plays standard country riffs while the band shuffles and swings. He switches between using the pick and thrumming his middle finger. On “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” his fingers fly up and down the fretboard.</p>
        <p>The Martin made Willie feel like he could do anything. He recorded Phases and Stages and then <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>, a spare, stripped-down masterpiece in which the man and his instrument are dependent on each other and even sound alike: raw and quivering with vibrato. You can hear Willie’s fingers pulling and pushing on the strings. You can hear the air in the room, the spaces in the music.</p>
        <p>In 1978, almost a decade after Willie had bought the Martin, he made the biggest album of his career, one that sounded like nothing he had done before. On <i>Shotgun Willie</i> and <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>, he was making his own kind of country music; now he was ready to make his own kind of music, period. <i>Stardust</i>—a collection of ten pop standards, many of which Django himself had recorded—was the Tin Pan Alley–jazz–country–pop synthesis he and his guitar had been leading each other to for years. Willie played elegantly in some places, forcefully in others, with a punchy, percussive attack. He sang behind the beat, making his voice tremble like Sinatra had done, and his guitar followed in kind.</p>
        <p>He was creating the most ambitious music of his life; his goals were bigger than just selling records. But the funny thing is, he was selling more records than ever. <i>Stardust</i>, his intimate self-portrait, would go on to sell more than five million copies.</p>
