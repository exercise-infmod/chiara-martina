            <p>Today, for better and for worse, the Internet is a part of all of 
                our lives. But it wasn’t always so. This week, we’re bringing 
                you pieces from the early days of tech culture, when going 
                online was a novelty and kids still played outside. In “My First 
                Flame,” from 1994, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seabrook">John Seabrook</a> describes his first experience 
                with online insults and <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trolling">trolling</a> 
                (“in any other medium, these words would be, literally, unspeakable”); he also undertakes an 
                electronic correspondence with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>, in “E-Mail from Bill.” (“We were intimate in a curious way, in the sense of 
                being wired into each other’s minds, but our contact was 
                elaborately stylized, like ballroom dancing.”) In “Virtual 
                Love,” from 1997, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan_Daum">Meghan Daum</a> 
                experiments with Internet dating, despite not being “what most people would call a ‘computer 
                person.’ ” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Heilemann">John Heilemann</a>, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassidy_(journalist)">John Cassidy</a>, 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Specter">Michael Specter</a> 
                offer early profiles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a> 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin">Sergey Brin</a>, 
                respectively. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Larson_(author)">Erik Larson</a> 
                recounts the story of iVillage, the Internet company whose two female 
                co-founders, Nancy Evans and Candice Carpenter, became 
                unimaginably rich through an <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ipo?q=I.P.O.">I.P.O.</a>, despite being “neither ‘Web 
                heads’ nor computer geeks,” signalling a new era in tech. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Collins_(journalist)">Lauren Collins</a> 
                explores a new form of self-expression—the clever naming 
                of one’s Wi-Fi network. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholson_Baker">Nicholson Baker</a> 
                uses a Kindle for the first time and wonders if a device could ever be better than a 
                book. Finally, in a Talk of the Town story, from 1977, Anthony 
                Hiss visits an <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/acquaintance">acquaintance</a> 
                in California with a new hobby: 
                assembling his own personal computer. Eventually, his 
                acquaintance predicts, people will “start hooking their machines 
                in with their friends’ machines, and people will get on nets of 
                computers, which could mean you could vote or buy something 
                while sitting at your own computer keyboard.” He notes that “if 
                the electricity fails, the kids will be in trouble.” He didn’t 
                know the half of it.</p>
